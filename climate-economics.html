<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.1</span> A Blocking Neoclassical Framework</h2>
<p><em>Brookes and Wagner</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With its fixation on equilibrium thinking and an exclusive focus on market factors that can be precisely measured, the neoclassical orthodoxy in economics is fundamentally unequipped to deal with today’s biggest problems. Change within the discipline is underway, but it cannot come fast enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The economics discipline has failed to understand the climate crisis – let alone provide effective policy solutions for it – because most economists tend to divide problems into small, manageable pieces. Rational people, they are wont to say, think at the margin. What matters is not the average or totality of one’s actions but rather the very next step, weighed against the immediate alternatives.Such thinking is indeed rational for small discrete problems. Compartmentalization is necessary for managing competing demands on one’s time and attention. But marginal thinking is inadequate for an all-consuming problem touching every aspect of society.Economists also tend to equate rationality with precision. The discipline’s power over public discourse and policymaking lies in its implicit claim that those who cannot compute precise benefits and costs are somehow irrational. This allows economists – and their models – to ignore pervasive climate risks and uncertainties, including the possibility of climatic tipping points and societal responses to them. And when one considers economists’ fixation with equilibrium models, the mismatch between the climate challenge and the discipline’s current tools becomes too glaring to ignore.Yes, a return to equilibrium – getting “back to normal” – is an all-too-human preference. But it is precisely the opposite of what is needed – rapidly phasing out fossil fuels – to stabilize the world’s climate.These limitations are reflected in benefit-cost analyses of cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The traditional thinking suggests a go-slow path for cutting CO2. The logic seems compelling: the cost of damage caused by climate change, after all, is incurred in the future, while the costs of climate action occur today. The Nobel prize-winning verdict is that we should delay necessary investment in a low-carbon economy to avoid hurting the current high-carbon economy.</p>
<p>The very structure of academic economics all but guarantees that marginal thinking continues to dominate. The most effective way to introduce new ideas into the peer-reviewed academic literature is to follow something akin to an 80/20-rule: stick to the established script for the most part; but try to push the envelope by probing one dubious assumption at a time. Needless to say, this makes it extremely difficult to change the overall frame of reference, even when those who helped establish the standard view are looking well beyond it themselves.</p>
<p>Because equilibrium thinking underpins the traditional climate-economic models that were developed in the 1990s, these models assume that there are tradeoffs between climate action and economic growth. They imagine a world where the economy simply glides along a Panglossian path of progress. Climate policy might still be worthwhile, but only if we are willing to accept costs that will throw the economy off its chosen path.Against the backdrop of this traditional view, recent pronouncements by the International Monetary Fund and the International Energy Agency are nothing short of revolutionary. Both institutions have now concluded that ambitious climate action leads to higher growth and more jobs even in the near term.The logic is straightforward: climate policies create many more jobs in clean-energy sectors than are lost in fossil-fuel sectors, reminding us that investment is the flipside of cost. That is why the proposal for a $2 trillion infrastructure package in the United States could be expected to spur higher net economic activity and employment. Perhaps more surprising is the finding that carbon pricing alone appears to reduce emissions without hurting jobs or overall economic growth. The problem with carbon taxes or emissions trading is that real-world policies are not reducing emissions fast enough and therefore will need to be buttressed by regulation.</p>
<p>The framework of neoclassical economics is still blocking progress. The discipline is long overdue for its own tipping point toward new modes of thinking commensurate with the climate challenge.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.2</span> Long-term Economic effects of Climate Change</h2>
<p><em>Kahn Abstract</em></p>
<p>We study the long-term impact of climate change on economic activity across countries, using a stochast<br />
ic growth model where labour productivity is affected by country-specific climate variables—defined as<br />
deviations of temperature and precipitation from their historical norms. Using a panel data set of 174<br />
countries over the years 1960 to 2014, we find that per-capita real output growth is adversely affected<br />
by persistent changes in the temperature above or below its historical norm, but we do not obtain any<br />
statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation. Our counterfactual analysis suggests th<br />
at a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04°C per year, in the absence of mitigation<br />
policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by 7.22 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the<br />
Paris Agreement, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01°C per annum, reduces the loss subst<br />
antially to 1.07 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries. We also provide supplement<br />
ary evidence using data on a sample of 48 U.S. states between 1963 and 2016, and show that climate chan<br />
ge has a long-lasting adverse impact on real output in various states and economic sectors, and on labo<br />
r productivity and employment.</p>
<p><em>Kahn Memo</em></p>
<p>By using deviations of climate variables from
their respective historical norms, while allowing for nonlinearity, we <em>avoid the econometric
pitfalls associated with the use of trended variables</em>, such as temperature, in output growth
equations. As it is well known, and is also documented in our paper, temperature has been
trending upward strongly in almost all countries in the world, and its use as a regressor in a
growth regression can lead to spurious estimates.</p>
<p>To measure the damage caused by climate change, economists have sought to quantify
how aggregate economic growth is being a¤ected by rising temperatures and changes in
rainfall patterns; see a recent survey by Dell et al. (2014)</p>
<p>The literature which attempts to quantify the e¤ects of climate change (temperature, pre-
cipitation, storms, and other aspects of the weather) on economic performance (agricultural
production, labour productivity, commodity prices, health, con‡ict, and economic growth)
is relatively recent and mainly concerned with <em>short-run</em> e¤ects</p>
<p>Moreover, there are a number of grounds on which the econometric evidence
of the e¤ects of climate change on growth may be questioned. Firstly, the literature relies
primarily on the cross-sectional approach
and as such does not take into account
the time dimension of the data (i.e., assumes that the observed relationship across countries
holds over time as well) and is also subject to the endogeneity (reverse causality) problem
given the possible feedback e¤ects from changes in output growth onto the climate variable.</p>
<p>Secondly, the …xed e¤ects (FE) estimators used in more recent panel-data studies im-
plicitly assume that climate variables are strictly exogenous, and thus rule out any reverse
causality from economic growth to rising average temperatures.</p>
<p>n his computable general equilibrium work, Nordhaus accounts
for the fact that faster economic activity increases the stock of greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions and thereby the average temperature. At the same time, rising average temperature
could reduce real economic activity. This equilibrium approach has important implications
for the econometric speci…cation of climate change–economic growth relationship.
In fact, recent studies on climate science provide strong evidence that the main cause of
contemporary global warming is the release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by human
activities.</p>
<p>Consequently, when estimating the
impact of climate change on economic growth, temperature (T it ) may not be considered
as strictly exogenous, but merely weakly exogenous/predetermined to income growth; in
other words economic growth in the past might have feedback e¤ects on future temperature.
While it is well known that the FE estimator su¤ers from small-T bias in dynamic panels
with N (the cross-section dimension) larger than T (the time series dimension).
This bias exists regardless of whether the lags of the dependent
variable are included or not, so long as one or more regressor is not strictly exogenous.
In such cases, inference based on the standard FE estimator will be invalid and can result in
large size distortions unless N=T ! 0, as N; T ! 1 jointly. Therefore, caution must be
exercised when interpreting the results from studies that use the standard FE estimators in
the climate change–economic growth literature given that N is often larger than T .
Thirdly, econometric speci…cations of the climate change–macroeconomic relation are
often written in terms of real GDP per capita growth and the level of temperature, T it , and
in some cases also T it 2 ; see, for instance, Dell et al. (2012) and Burke et al. (2015). But if T it
is trended, which is the case in almost all countries in the world (see Section 3.1), inclusion
of T it in the regression will induce a quadratic trend in equilibrium log per capita output (or
equivalently a linear trend in per capita output growth) which is not desirable and can bias
the estimates of the growth–climate change equation. Finally, another major drawback of
this literature is that the econometric speci…cations of the climate change–growth relation
are generally not derived from or based on a theoretical growth model. Either an ad hoc
approach is used, where real income growth is regressed on a number of arbitrarily–chosen
variables, or a theoretical model is developed but not put to a rigorous empirical test.</p>
<p>We contribute to the climate change–economic growth literature along the following di-
mensions. Firstly, we extend the stochastic single-country growth models of Merton (1975),
Brock and Mirman (1972), and Binder and Pesaran (1999) to N countries sharing a common
technology but di¤erent climate conditions. Our theoretical model postulates that labour
productivity in each country is a¤ected by a common technological factor and country-
specific climate variables, which we take to be average temperature, T it , and precipitation,
P it , in addition to other country-specific idiosyncratic shocks. As long as T it and P it remain
close to their respective historical norms (regarded as technologically neutral), they are not
expected to a¤ect labour productivity. However, if climate variables deviate from their his-
torical norms, the e¤ects on labour productivity could be positive or negative, depending on
the region under consideration. For example, in a historically cold region, a rise in temper-
ature above its historical norm might result in higher labour productivity, whilst for a dry
region, a fall in precipitation below its historical norms is likely to have adverse e¤ects on
labour productivity. 2 Secondly, contrary to much of the literature which is mainly concerned
with short-term growth e¤ects, we explicitly model and test the long-run growth e¤ects of
persistent increases in temperature. Thirdly, we use the half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE)
estimator proposed in Chudik et al. (2018) to deal with the possible bias and size distortion
of the commonly-used FE estimator (given that T it is weakly exogenous). When the time
imension of the panel is moderate relative to N , the HPJ-FE estimator e¤ectively corrects
the Nickel-type bias if regressors are weakly exogenous, and is robust to possible feedback
e¤ects from aggregate economic activity to the climate variables.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that a persistent change
in the climate has a long-term negative e¤ect on per capita GDP growth.</p>
<p>Our empirical findings
apply equally to poor or rich, and hot or cold countries.</p>
<p>We show that
an increase in average global temperature of 0:04 C per year— corresponding to the Repre-
sentative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario (see Figure 1), which assumes higher
greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of mitigation policies— reduces world’s real GDP
per capita by 7:22 percent by 2100. Limiting the increase to 0.01 C per annum, which corre-
sponds to the December 2015 Paris Agreement, reduces the output loss substantially to 1:07
percent.</p>
<p>To put our results into perspective, the conclusions one might draw from most of the
existing climate change–macroeconomy literature are the following: (i) when a poor (hot)
country is 1 C warmer than usual, its income growth falls by 1–2 percentage points in the
short- to medium-term; (ii) when a rich (temperate) country is 1 C warmer than usual,
there is little impact on its economic activity; and (iii) the GDP e¤ect of increases in average
temperatures (with or without adaptation and/or mitigation policies) is relatively small— a
few percent decline in the level of GDP per capita over the next century (see, Figure 2).
In contrast, our counterfactual estimates suggest that all regions (cold or hot, and rich or
poor) would experience a relatively large fall in GDP per capita by 2100 in the absence of
climate change policies (i.e., the RCP 8.5 scenario). However, the size of these income e¤ects
varies across countries depending on the projected paths of temperatures.</p>
<p>Burke et al. (2015) consider an alternative panel specification that
adds quadratic climate variables to the equation
and detect: (i) non-linearity in the relationship; (ii) di¤erential impact on rich versus poor
countries; and (iii) noisy medium-term growth e¤ects— their higher lag order (between 1
and 5) estimates reported in Supplementary Table S2, show that only 3 out of 18 estimates
are statistically significant. Overall, apart from the econometric shortcomings of existing
studies, robust evidence for the long-run growth e¤ects of climate change are nonexistent in
the literature. However, our results show that an increase in temperature above its historical
norm is associated with lower economic growth in the long run— suggesting that the welfare
e¤ects of climate change are signi…cantly underestimated in the literature. Therefore, our
findings call for a more forceful policy response to climate change.</p>

<p><em>Dell Abstract</em></p>
<p>A rapidly growing body of research applies panel methods to examine how
temperature, precipitation, and windstorms influence economic outcomes. These
studies focus on changes in weather realizations over time within a given spatial area
and demonstrate impacts on agricultural output, industrial output, labor productivity,
energy demand, health, conflict, and economic growth, among other outcomes. By
harnessing exogenous variation over time within a given spatial unit, these studies
help credibly identify (i) the breadth of channels linking weather and the economy, (ii)
heterogeneous treatment effects across different types of locations, and (iii) nonlinear
effects of weather variables. This paper reviews the new literature with two purposes.
First, we summarize recent work, providing a guide to its methodologies, datasets, and
findings. Second, we consider applications of the new literature, including insights for
the “damage function” within models that seek to assess the potential economic effects
of future climate change.</p>
<p><em>Dell Memo</em></p>
<p>The
difficulty in identifying causative effects
from cross-sectional evidence has posed
substantial and long-standing challenges for
understanding the historical, contemporary,
and future economic consequences of climate and climate change.</p>
<p>In the last few years, there has been a wave
of new empirical research that takes a different approach.
These new studies use panel
methodologies, exploiting high-frequency
(e.g., year-to-year) changes in temperature,
precipitation, and other climatic variables to
identify these variables’ economic effects.
As nomenclature, this new literature uses
“weather variation” to describe shorter-run
temporal variation. The word climate is
reserved for the distribution of outcomes,
which may be summarized by averages over
several decades, while weather describes a
particular realization from that distribution
and can provide substantial variability.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of the new lit-
erature is <em>identification</em>. By exploiting
exogenous variation in weather outcomes
over time within a given spatial area, these
methods can causatively identify effects of
temperature, precipitation, and windstorm
variation on numerous outcomes, including
agricultural output, energy demand, labor
productivity, mortality, industrial output,
exports, conflict, migration, and economic
growth. This literature has thus provided a
host of new results about the ways in which
the realizations of temperature, precipita-
tion, storms, and other aspects of the weather
affect the economy.</p>
<p>This literature has important implications for the “damage function”
in climate change models.
The opportunity here is to bring causative identification to the damage functions, elucidating
the set of important climate–economy channels and their functional forms.
The challenge lies in bridging from the evidentiary
basis of short-run weather effects to thinking
about longer-run effects of changes in the
distribution of weather, which may be either
larger (e.g., due to intensification effects)
or smaller (e.g., due to adaptation) than the
short-run impacts. While certain climate
change aspects are difficult to assess, we
examine a number of empirical methodologies that can help bridge toward longer-run
effects while maintaining careful identification.</p>
<p>climate studies often seek
to estimate the contemporaneous effect of
temperature on economic activity for the
purpose of assessing the potential impacts
of forecasted temperature changes over the
next several decades. The ­
cross-sectional
relationship, which represents a very
long-run equilibrium, may incorporate processes
that are too slow to accurately inform
the time scale of interest, or it may include
historical processes (such as colonialism) that
will not repeat themselves in modern times.</p>
<p>To the extent that one is interested in iso-
lating the impact of climatic variables such
as temperature—apart from the many other
factors that they are correlated with and
have influenced over the very long run—a
different approach is to use longitudinal
data to investigate the effects of weather
shocks. This approach, which is the focus
of this review, has emerged in recent years
and emphasizes variation over time within a
given spatial entity.</p>
<p>The literature
uses a nomenclature of “weather varia-
tion” for shorter-run temporal variation, as
opposed to “climate variation,” where the
word climate is used to describe the distribution of outcomes
while weather
refers to a particular realization from that
distribution.</p>
<p>A related issue is the inclusion of lags of the
dependent variable, ​ y​ it ​ . Including these lags
biases coefficient estimates in short panel
models, 4 yet excluding the lagged dependent
variable may also bias the estimates if it is an
important part of the data-generating pro-
cess. While what comprises a “short” panel
will depend on the data-generating process,
Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the
bias can be nonnegligible with panel lengths
of T = 10 or even T = 15.</p>
<p>A further implementation question
involves the appropriate functional form
for the weather variables. One common
approach measures ​
C ​ it ​ in “levels” (e.g.,
degrees Celsius for temperature or millime-
ters for precipitation). In the panel set up,
the identification thus comes from devia-
tions in levels from the mean. 7 Another common
approach, aimed at revealing nonlinear
effects, considers the frequencies at which
the weather realizations fall into different
bins.</p>
<p>A different approach emphasizes “anom-
alies,” where the weather variable is cal-
culated as its level difference from the
within-spatial-area mean and divided by
­
the within-spatial-area standard deviation.
The first part—the difference in mean—is
already captured in a broad sense by the
panel model. The second part—scaling by
the standard deviation—takes a particular
view of the underlying climate–economy
model where level changes matter not in an
absolute sense but in proportion to an area’s
usual variation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, outcome-specific approaches
may be preferred where existing research
provides guidance. For example, knowledge
of biological processes in agriculture sug-
gest refined temperature measures such as
“degree-days” for crop growth, possibly with
crop-specific thresholds.</p>
<p>s a general rule, imposing specific func-
tional forms on the data, such as crop degree-
days, is useful to the extent that one has
confidence in the specific model of the pro-
cess that translates weather to economic out-
comes. The more agnostic about the model,
the more general the researcher would like
to be about the functional form.</p>
<p>There are two notable interpretative
issues with the panel models that, while
not calling into question the experimental
validity of the regression design, do raise
questions about their external validity for
processes such as global warming. One
interpretive challenge is whether and how
the effects of medium- or long-run changes
in climatic variables will differ from the
effects of short-run fluctuations. A second
issue is that panel models, in focusing on
idiosyncratic local variation, also neutral-
ize broader variation that may be of poten-
tial interest, including general equilibrium
effects that spill across spatial borders or are
global in nature, like effects on commodity
prices.</p>
<p><em>Data</em></p>
<p>There are currently four principal types of
weather data: ground station data, gridded
data, satellite data, and reanalysis data.
The
most basic type of data are from ground stations,
which typically directly observe tem-
perature, precipitation, and other weather
variables such as wind speed and direction,
humidity, and barometric pressure. Gridded
data provide more complete coverage by
interpolating station information over a grid.
Satellite data use satellite-based readings
to infer various weather variables. Finally,
reanalysis data combine information from
ground stations, satellites, weather balloons,
and other inputs with a climate model to
estimate weather variables across a grid.</p>
<p>Different interpolation schemes
can produce different estimates, particularly
in short time periods and particularly for
precipitation. Precipitation has a far greater
spatial variation than temperature, especially
in rugged areas, and thus is more difficult
to interpolate.</p>
<p>While satellite data can provide important
weather information for areas with a limited
ground network, satellite data are not
necessarily a panacea. Satellites were launched
relatively recently, so their data does not
extend back nearly as far historically as
other ­datasets. Furthermore, an individual
ground station is more accurate than the
satellite data for that particular location,
in part because satellites do not directly
measure temperature or precipitation, but
rather make inferences from electromag-
netic reflectivity in various wavelength
bands. Lastly, a s ­ atellite-based series is not
drawn from a single satellite, but rather
from a series of satellites. Sensors have
changed subtly over the years and, within a
particular satellite, corrections are needed
due to subtle changes in the satellite’s orbit
over time and other factors.</p>
<p>The key difference between
reanalysis and gridded data is that, rather
than use a statistical procedure to interpolate
between observations, a climate model
is used.</p>
<p>One approach is to aggregate spatially;
that is, to overlay administrative or other
boundaries with the gridded weather dataset
and take a simple area-weighted average of
weather variables within the administrative
unit, which can be done easily using GIS soft-
ware. However, this approach will lead large
areas with little economic activity and sparse
populations (such as deserts, rain forests, or
the Arctic) to dominate the weather aver-
ages of large spatial units such as the United
States, Russia, and Brazil. A second approach
is, therefore, to aggregate using a fixed set
of population weights, so that the relevant
concept is the average weather experienced
by a person in the administrative area, not
the average weather experienced by a place.</p>
<p>Overall, the studies discussed in this sec-
tion document that temperature, precipi-
tation, and extreme weather events exert
economically meaningful and statistically
significant influences on a variety of eco-
nomic outcomes. These impacts illustrate
the multifaceted nature of the ­
weather–
economy relationship, with numerous appli-
cations for understanding historical, present,
and future economic outcomes and possible
policy responses. For example, the effects of
weather variables on mortality rates, labor
productivity, energy demand, and agricul-
tural output can inform investments and
policy design around public health, air-con-
ditioning, energy infrastructure, and agricul-
tural technologies. Moreover, these studies
can help inform classic issues of economic
development, especially the role of geo-
graphic features in influencing development
paths. Finally, these analyses may inform
estimates of the economic costs of future
climatic change. The possibility of future
climatic change has been a primary motive
for the recent, rapid growth of this literature.</p>
<p><em>Results</em></p>
<p>Cross-country empirical analyses show a
strong negative relationship between hot cli-
mates and income per capita.</p>
<p>Panel studies exploit the exogeneity of
cross-time weather variation, allowing for
causative identification.</p>
<p>In a world sample from 1950 to 2003, Dell,
Jones, and Olken (2012) examine how annual
variation in temperature and precipitation
affects per capita income. They show that
being 1°C warmer in a given year reduces
per capita income by 1.4 percent, but only
in poor countries. Moreover, estimating a
model with lags of temperature, they find
that this large effect is not reversed once
the temperature shock is over, suggesting
that temperature is affecting growth rates,
not just income levels. 22 Growth effects,
which compound over time, have potentially
first-order consequences for the scale of eco-
nomic damages over the longer run, greatly
exceeding level effects on income, and are
thus an important area for further modeling
and research.</p>
<p>While the production function is
often calibrated through the use of experimental
data, it has been criticized for not
realistically modeling real farmer behavior in
real settings. For example, many studies do
not allow farmers to adopt new crops when
the temperature input into the production
function changes, nor do they allow farmers
to switch their cultivated land to livestock or
nonfarm use.
To address these concerns, Mendelsohn,
Nordhaus, and Shaw (1994) developed a
second approach, which they called the
Ricardian approach, that instead used
cross-sectional regressions with land values
to recover the net impacts of climate on agri-
cultural productivity. By analyzing farm land
prices as a function of climate and a host of
other characteristics, they estimated that the
impacts of climate change would be much
smaller than those estimated by the production
function approach and might even be
positive.</p>
<p>In estimating a
cross-sectional relationship like equation (2)
for irrigated areas, which transport water
from other locations, the localized climate
is not the key determinant of production.</p>
<p>Understanding
nonlinearities becomes important when con-
sidering the impact of global climate change
because a right-shift in the distribution of
average temperature causes a disproportionate
increase in the number of very hot days.</p>
<p>The possibility of adaptation was a major argument for
the approach of Mendelsohn, Nordhaus,
and Shaw (1994), since presumably, changes
in land values would incorporate future
adaptation effects.</p>
<p>Modern lab experiments have investi-
gated the impact of temperature on pro-
ductivity. Subjects are typically randomly
assigned to rooms of varying temperatures
and asked to perform cognitive and physical
tasks. Examples of tasks shown to respond
adversely to hot temperatures in laboratory
settings include estimation of time, vigilance,
and higher cognitive functions, such as men-
tal arithmetic and simulated flight.</p>
<p>Observational and experimental studies
also show a strong relationship between tem-
perature and the productivity of factory, call
center, and office workers, as well as students.
Within
the range of temperatures from 22–29oC,
each additional oC is associated with a reduc-
tion of about 1.8 percent in labor produc-
tivity.
The
relationship is complex and find that other
aspects (e.g., humidity, amount of outdoor
air, carbon dioxide levels) have complex inter-
actions with ­temperature.
A meta-analysis of these
studies concludes that increasing temperature
from 23 to 30oC reduces productivity by about
9 percent.</p>
<p>Industrial output using aggregated data
center approximately on a 2 percent output
loss per 1°C.</p>
<p>Large effects of windstorms on industrial production.
Effects of precipitation on
industrial output appear slight, although only
one study looks at extremely heavy precipitation
and in that case finds modest negative
effects.</p>
<p><em>Energy</em></p>
<p>The literature has looked extensively at
how climatic variables, in particular temper-
ature, influence energy consumption. This
relationship, which has received renewed
attention in light of potential climate change,
has long been important for the design of
electricity systems, where demand varies
with climate and weather. Understanding
temperature effects matters for the energy
consequences per se and for potential feed-
back loops, incorporated into some climatic
models, where
energy demand influences greenhouse
gas ­emissions, which in turn affects future
energy demand.</p>
<p>A clear U-shape
relationship between energy demand and
temperature, with an extra day below 10oF
or above 90oF raising annual energy demand
by 0.3–0.4 percent.</p>
<p>These panel-data papers, in using tempera-
ture bins, depart from a prior practice of using
“heating degree days” (HDD) and “cool-
ing degree days” (CDD), which count the
number of days below and above a threshold
temperature, with each day weighted by its
temperature difference from the threshold.
This degree-days approach misses the con-
vexity found in the ­nonparametric approach,
where extreme temperatures provoke much
stronger energy demand increases. The con-
vexity of the U-shape appears important both
in getting the energy demand estimation cor-
rect and in light of climate change models,
which show an increasing number of very
hot days. Partly for this reason, Deschênes
and Greenstone (2011) and Auffhammer
and Aroonruengsawat (2011) find that the
net effect of warming over the twenty-first
century is likely to increase energy demand
substantially, ceteris paribus, with these
studies estimating 11 percent and 3 percent
demand increases respectively.</p>
<p><em>Trade and Innovation</em></p>
<p>Trade can, in principle, dampen or exacerbate local
effects of productivity losses.
Another potentially first-order adaptation
mechanism is innovation.</p>
<p>The unusual identification opportunity
provided by weather shocks has allowed a
rigorous analysis of weather–economy link-
ages, and implications for breadth, hetero-
geneity, and functional forms. While much
work remains in developing a detailed under-
standing of the underlying mechanisms,
especially for macroeconomic and politi-
cal economy outcomes, the new literature
shows that weather variation has substantive
effects in contemporary periods. This begins
to suggest policy targets, whether the goal is
preventing substantial economic damages or
protecting public health and security.</p>
<p><em>From short to long run: Econometrics</em></p>
<p>While tem-
perature changes over the next thirty years
will plausibly be within this range (recall
the IPCC middle estimates were between
1.8–3.1oC by 2100), the ninety-fifth percentile
estimate is warming of 7oC by 2100. If
the impacts of climatic variables are linear
throughout this range, then extrapolation
is not an issue per se. However, if there are
nonlinearities that are different from those
operating within historical experience, one
cannot directly extrapolate from equation (3)
to climate scenarios far outside this range.</p>
<p>This issue suggests a limited capacity for
panel models to provide quantitative estimates
of damages from extreme warming.</p>
<p>hese issues highlight that, even though
panel models of the form of equation (3)
correctly identify the causal effect of weather
shocks on contemporaneous economic out-
comes, they may not estimate the structural
equation of interest for understanding the
likely effects of future global climate change.
Moreover, even leaving aside the potential
of catastrophic climate scenarios, such as
rapid sea-level rise or the release of methane
from melting permafrost that could greatly
increase global temperature, the panel esti-
mates are neither obviously an upper bound
nor a lower bound for the effect of climate
change. If the adaptation force dominates,
then the effects of weather shocks will tend to
be larger than the effects of climate change;
if the intensification force dominates, then
the effects of weather shocks will tend to be
smaller than the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Longer-difference estimates are
perhaps the closest empirical analogue to
the structural equation of interest for climate change.</p>
<p>To the extent that adaptation
requires forward-looking investments, adap-
tation choices will depend not only on the
underlying damage functions and adaptation
possibilities, but also on agents’ expectations.
Responses will depend on whether agents
both were aware of the change in average
temperature, and whether they perceived it
to be a permanent change or just an accumulation of idiosyncratic shocks.</p>
<p>The challenge is that economies are chang-
ing and the longer the time difference taken
in (8), the further back in time the analysis
goes (by necessity), and the further removed
from present-day economic conditions the
analysis becomes. To the extent that differ-
ent economies presented very different standards of living, technologies, and institutions
through the twentieth century, one may still
make headway by examining historical heterogeneous treatment effects along various
dimensions of economic development. On
the other hand, the future presumably prom-
ises new technologies and other features that
may pull economies outside the range of
historical experiences, calling for caution in
drawing sharp conclusions from increasingly
historical studies.</p>
<p>Long-run studies illustrate
that factor reallocation may be an important mechanism.</p>
<p><em>IAMs</em></p>
<p>Our focus is on the damage function,
the component of IAMs that specifies how
increased temperatures affect economic
activity.</p>
<p>IAMs used for economic policy analysis typi-
cally include four broad components: 1) a
model projecting the path for greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions; 2) a model mapping GHG
emissions into climatic change; 3) a damage
function that calculates the economic costs
of climatic change, and; 4) a social welfare
function for aggregating damages over time
and potentially across space.</p>
<p>All IAMs must
make a wide variety of modeling choices, with
large uncertainties remaining across each
component.</p>
<p>The possibility
of positive feedback loops implies that mod-
eled climate change predictions are right-
skewed; in other words, there are “fat tail”
probabilities for massive climatic change in
the next century.</p>
<p>IAMs must specify
a social welfare function that discounts the
future path of consumption.</p>
<p>The concavity of the utility
function. This property influences not only
how one weighs future versus current generations,
but also how one weighs rich versus
poor economies at a single point in time.</p>
<p>Different IAMs model the climate-dam-
age function in somewhat different ways.
For example, the DICE/RICE models
use a Cobb–Douglas production function
with capital and labor as inputs, multi-
plied by TFP, which grows at a constant,
exogenously specified rate. Output is then
reduced by the climate-damage function.
For example, in the DICE model, the
damage function is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D(T) = frac{1}{1+Pi_1 T + Pi-2 T^2}\]</span></p>
<p>DICE calibrates the π parameters to match
cross-sectional estimates of climate damages
reviewed in Tol (2009).</p>
<p>In the FUND model, rather than spec-
ify an aggregate damage function directly,
climate damages are calculated at the
region-by-sector level and aggregated up;
­
that is, FUND posits separate models for
agriculture, forestry, energy consumption,
and health (deaths from infectious, cardio-
vascular, and respiratory disease), while also
considering water resources, extreme storm
damage, sea level rise, and the value for eco-
systems, with potentially separate regional
parameters for each of these models.</p>
<p>An important challenge with the current
damage functions is that, for the most part,
they do not incorporate the type of rigor-
ous empirical evidence on climate damages
reviewed here.
In a recent review of IAMs,
when discussing the calibration of the D(T)
function, Pindyck (2013) writes “the choice
of values for these parameters is essentially
guesswork. The usual approach is to select
values such that [D(T)] for T in the range of
2°C to 4°C is consistent with common wis-
dom regarding the damages that are likely
to occur for small to moderate increases in
temperature. . . . The bottom line here is that
the damage functions used in most IAMs are
completely made up, with no theoretical or
empirical foundation.”</p>
<p>The implications of the econometric evidence
discussed here can be thought of in
two respects: how we model and calibrate
the climate-damage function at a point in
time, and how the climate-damage function
evolves over time.</p>
<p>A key modeling choice for the dam-
age function is whether climate affects the
level of output or the growth path of output.
The main IAMs assume that
the impact of climate is on the level of output
only with the growth of total-factor productivity
continuing exogenously.
Because growth effects,
even small ones, will ultimately dominate
even large-level effects, ruling out growth
effects substantially limits the possible
economic damages these models allow.</p>
<p>An alternative way of specifying the dam-
age function is to allow climate to affect the
long-run growth rate directly.
Understanding the functional form through
which climate affects economic output is
critical.
While it is hard to know definitively
the correct functional form for the loss func-
tion, even small impacts on productivity
growth could, over time, swamp effects on
the level of output.</p>
<p>Building IAMs is a challenging exercise with enormous uncertainty.</p>
<p>We are optimistic that
the damage function can be substantially
informed by the recent wave of new empirical
research, which has begun to provide key
insights.</p>
<p>Integrating across the many studies
reviewed, several broad themes emerge.</p>
<p>First, there is a wide range of channels
through which weather shocks affect eco-
nomic outcomes. Shocks, especially temper-
ature, affect agricultural output, industrial
output, energy demand, labor productivity,
health, conflict, political stability, and eco-
nomic growth. Labor productivity effects
alone may suggest potentially economywide
mechanisms. Moreover, the magnitudes of
the effects are often substantive. An inter-
esting linkage appears across studies of labor
productivity, industrial output, and economic
growth, where estimates converge around a
1–2 percent loss per 1°C in poor countries.</p>
<p>Second, the panel studies provide an
emerging set of key insights about functional
forms.
Effects are often
not simple linear functions independent of
context.
High sensitivity to extreme temperatures, but
little or no sensitivity to temperature changes
within moderate temperature ranges.
International and internal trade effects,
including studies of how integrated mar-
kets both mute and transmit shocks.</p>
<p>Panel
methodologies can also study medium-run
and longer-run changes directly. Keeping in
mind that countries have warmed substan-
tially on average in the last several decades,
with substantial variance within and across
countries, there is ample capacity to study
medium-run changes. The recent warm-
ing rate is also very similar to that predicted
by many climate models through at least
the middle of the current century. Noting
that climate change is not about a perma-
nent climate shock, but rather about a sto-
chastic warming process along an upward
trend, recent historical experience, which
has occurred on such a stochastic warming
trajectory, provides a highly relevant set-
ting to understand warming effects.</p>
