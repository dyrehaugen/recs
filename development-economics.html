<h1><span class="header-section-number">26</span> Development Economics</h1>
<p><em>Trainer</em></p>
<p>Thinking about development is dominated by a conventional conception which takes
for granted the centrality of increasing production for sale, integration into the
globalized market place, moving to more sophisticated technologies, and the goal of
rising to affluent rich-world living standards. Basic criticisms of this conception of
development are briefly summarized, firstly to do with the way it has primarily
benefitted the rich and secondly regarding its grossly unsustainable resource
implications. Global biophysical resource endowments prohibit its realization. There
has been remarkably little thinking from conventional or critical sources on the goals
and means which a sustainable alternative must take. The Simpler Way project is
concerned to show the necessity for, and desirability and workability of, the
development of mostly small scale, cooperative, highly self-sufficient and self-
governing local economies focused on meeting basic needs, and not concerned with
economic growth, globalization, competing in the global market place, or aspiring to
rich-world “living standards.” It is argued that only some form of Simpler Way can
enable satisfactory global development within sustainable resource and ecological
limits.</p>
<p>The major fault in most if not all previous development thinking has been
failure to grasp the need for materially simple lifestyles and systems.</p>
<p>Conventional development can be regarded as a form of legitimized plunder.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative, appropriate development … The simpler way</strong></p>
<p>The basic element in appropriate development is the small, highly self-sufficient
and largely co-operative local economy.</p>
<p>The transition can be a process of gradually building a new “Needs-Driven-Economy”
underneath the old “Profit-Driven-Economy.” It can begin by a few coming together as a
Community Development Cooperative to organize the provision of some neglected basic
goods and services, for example by setting up community gardens, poultry co-ops or
aged care rosters. Their long term goal would be to increase these cooperative, socially
desirable non-market activities until they might largely replace the old economy.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.1</span> Structural Reforms</h2>
<p><em>Braun on Draghi’s ‘Refrorm Thesis’</em></p>
<p>Draghi was a structural reformer avant la lettre: He uses the term “reform” exactly as it would come to be used in “structural reforms.” Except that the concept didn’t exist at the time.</p>
<p>Draghi’s thesis fully articulates the theory that came to bring us structural reforms: A planner opting for short-run stimulus will never reach the optimal long-run path. By contrast, enforcing optimum long-run policies today will <em>not</em> have negative short-run consequences.</p>
<p>Noting that “the common finding is a positive relationship between real wages and employment,” Draghi seeks to refute that finding, describing it an artifact of faulty methodological choices.</p>
<p>Structural reformers <em>must</em> reject the idea of a positive wage-employment relationship because SRs are supposed to boost employment precisely via lower real wages.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BJMbraun/status/1387737805405802498">Braun - Twitter Thread on Mario Draghi’s Thesis</a></p>
<p><em>Tooze on Draghi/Yellen new assignments</em></p>
<p>It would be absurd to blame either Draghi or Yellen personally for the sequence of shifts and shocks that has destabilized capitalist democracies since the 1990s or the crisis of confidence these have triggered among centrist liberals. But as people of huge influence and as representatives of a class of experts who have ruled the roost for the last 30 years, they can hardly plead innocence either. It was on their watch that growth slowed, inequality between social classes and regions became ever deeper, and the risk of inflation tipped into that of deflation. It was on their watch that the financial system was allowed to become a flywheel of mass destruction. It was on their watch that the risks of climate change and pandemic threats went unaddressed.</p>
<p>If broad-based growth cannot be restarted, the implications are alarming.</p>
<p>Whereas the market revolutionaries of the 1970s and ’80s were radicals, squashing the last bastions of the old left and bulldozing organized labor out of the way, Draghi and Yellen came to the fore in the 1990s as managers of what is now known as the Great Moderation.</p>
<p>Inheritors of the market revolution, committed to managing and improving the status quo, Draghi’s and Yellen’s march through the institutions has been glorious, but their careers have also been defined by constant adjustment to political and economic shocks that they did not foresee and could not control. These shocks have driven Yellen and Draghi to explore the political and economic boundaries of technocratic power.</p>
<p>At MIT and Yale in the 1970s, they imbibed what was known as the neoclassical synthesis. The central idea was that though the microeconomics of markets were important, markets would function properly only so long as the macroeconomic environment was set correctly. Keynesianism and market economics were not opposites but complements.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Yellen played an important part in shaping the further development of the neoclassical synthesis known as New Keynesian economics. Working alongside the likes of Joseph Stiglitz and George Akerlof, she mapped how labor market imperfections could give rise to macroeconomic problems.
Those rigidities in wages and prices, in turn, also enabled macroeconomic policy to work. It was because markets were slow to adjust that unexpected movements in interest rates, taxes, and government spending could have real effects.</p>
<p>Draghi’s work at MIT was less intellectually generative than Yellen’s. But his dissertation is nevertheless revealing. It includes a chapter in which he describes how planners trying to manage an economy subject to short-run fluctuation are more successful if they focus on long-run goals. Long-range strategy, regardless of short-term cost, will do better than a hectic effort to optimize at every moment.</p>
<p>Though they owe little to the Chicago school, it does not follow that Draghi and Yellen were not exponents of neoliberalism. On the contrary: They were strong advocates of markets.
Competition and properly designed incentives were the recipe for productivity and growth.</p>
<p>In the world economy, they favored the free capital movement and flexible exchange rates that defined the so-called Washington Consensus of the 1990s. It was Rudiger Dornbusch, the pope of international macroeconomics at MIT and one of Draghi’s chief mentors, who described the project of his generation as being the taming of “democratic money.” In the wake of the collapse of the Bretton Woods financial order and the U.S. dollar’s gold peg, the chief enemies of good economic governance were shortsighted trade unions pushing for higher wages and vote-chasing politicians. Once trade unions were curbed and politicians confined to their proper tasks, Friedmanite monetarists hoped that prices could be stabilized by mechanical monetary rules.</p>
<p>But by the early 1980s, that had proved naive. For the MIT crowd, what keeping money safe from democracy amounted to was placing it under the control of competent experts credibly committed to providing markets with the stable framework they needed. The independent central bank was their institutional bastion.</p>
<p>The global financial order developed by economic elites—from the 19th-century gold standard to the gold-pegged dollar of the Bretton Woods system to the worldwide preoccupation with independent central banks after Bretton Woods dissolved—has always involved imposing constraints on policymakers. In the 1980s, devices such as exchange rate pegs were all the rage in Asia as well as Europe for signaling self-discipline to financial markets.</p>
<p>For all their inside status and expertise, neither Yellen nor Draghi gave any public sign of anticipating the crisis that was to come. The same was true for the vast majority of their cohort, whether MIT or Chicago. The scale of the systemic risk posed by the financial system of the advanced economies simply did not register until it was too late.</p>
<p>The consistent failure to deliver adequate fiscal policy responses to the crisis after 2008 went against all the preconceptions of 1970s MIT-style macroeconomics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where were the spendthrift politicians when you needed them? The fiscal undershoot by the Obama administration could perhaps be explained by miscalculation and Republican partisanship. But the fact that a centrist majority in the heart of Europe, faced with dangerous populist challenges from the left and right, would choose to die on the hill of budget balance was not part of the plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was up to the ECB to act. In 2015, to the horror of German conservatives, Draghi finally launched a QE program. This was a technical economic measure. But it had spectacular political effects. It enabled the European Council to play hardball with the radical left-wing government in Greece without causing the bond markets to panic.
One might say it marked the Americanization of the ECB.</p>
<p>Seven years on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a majority on the Fed board was swinging toward tightening. The point was not so much that the U.S. economy needed restraining as that they were deeply uncomfortable with interest rates remaining at zero. It stoked speculation in financial markets and gave the Fed nowhere to go if it needed to counter a downturn. Negative interest rates along the lines adopted by Japan were not something that the Fed wanted to contemplate.</p>
<p>The basic framework of 1970s macroeconomics that framed Draghi and Yellen’s training and outlook, like that of the rest of their cohort, was that properly structured markets would take care of growth. Well-regulated financial systems were stable. The chief priority for economists was to educate and restrain politicians to ensure that inflation remained in check and public debts were sustainable.</p>
<p>Financial instability is a mortal risk. For now, it is being held at bay. But the world saw as recently as March 2020 how rapidly even the largest financial market—the market for U.S. Treasurys—can be destabilized. To tame that risk, the Fed and the ECB, under Yellen’s and Draghi’s non-economist successors—Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde, respectively—have adopted an astonishingly undogmatic and expansive approach to stabilization.</p>
<p>The Italian political class is abdicating in favor of a retired, unelected official in his 70s.</p>
<p>Faced with a decisive historical challenge—restarting growth after decades of stagnation—Italy’s political class has chosen to delegate executive power to someone who has never been elected to office. It is the ultimate victory of technocracy but also a do-or-die challenge.</p>
<p>The truly strategic challenge facing progressive politics in the United States as in Europe is to find a new model of inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth</p>
<p>In the 1990s, you didn’t need to be a naive exponent of the post-Cold War end-of-history argument to think that the direction of travel for global politics was clear. The future belonged to globalization and more-or-less regulated markets. The pace was set by the United States. That enabled technocratic governments to be organized around a division between immediate action and long-term payoff. That was the trade-off that Draghi evaluated in his MIT Ph.D. in the 1970s. The drama of Draghi and Yellen’s final act is that for both of them, and not just for personal reasons, the trade-off is no longer so clear-cut. If the short-term politics fail, the long-term game may not be winnable at all. “Whatever it takes” has never meant more than it does today.</p>
