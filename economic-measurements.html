<h3><span class="header-section-number">27.1.1</span> GDP and EBITDA</h3>
<p>While the deficiencies of GDP as a measure have been well known, less emphasized has
been the fact that every single financial statement with which we build GDP exhibits the same
deficiency of being a limited barometer of value. Ironically, the main users of these financial
statements, in the business and financial sectors, are wise to the incompleteness of certain
metrics within financial statements, but act in a way that indicates they are oblivious – or
perhaps just willing to overlook – the incompleteness of financial statements writ large.
To explain, consider that GDP exhibits clear parallels with the profit metric of EBITDA
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Though there are technical
differences of formulation, GDP and EBITDA both represent partial measures of “wealth
creation” disembedded from a fuller conception of value. However, while financiers are wise
to the deficiencies of EBITDA, they have not acknowledged that the same pattern of
incompleteness reappears at the level of the overall financial statement – and then at the yet
higher level of GDP.
With the “DA,” EBITDA conveys the profitability of a company as if it would never again have
to spend a dollar on keeping its factories, equipment, property and software in good repair
and up to date. In other words, EBITDA excludes the cost of maintaining in good condition the
whole infrastructure upon which a company depends! It is the homeowner’s fantasy of how
wealthy they would be if they never had to fix or repair anything in their house ever again.</p>
<p>EBITDA came to prominence during the leveraged buyout (LBO) boom of the 1980s. As
Moody’s recounted in 2000: “LBO sponsors and bankers have promoted the use of EBITDA
for its obvious image benefits. EBITDA creates the appearance of stronger interest coverage
and lower financial leverage.” As a general rule, beware profit metrics promising image
benefits. Forbes was blunter still: “EBITDA is essentially a tool that shows what a company</p>
<p>would look like if it wasn’t actually that company.”
EBITDA is now clearly recognized as a “wool-over-your-eyes” measure, such that accounting
authorities deny it official status. It is a “non-GAAP” metric – not a Generally Accepted
Accounting Principle. Its ongoing ubiquity – besides being trivially easy to calculate – is
because it masks the fact that a business may be overleveraged – that it may have borrowed
against its future more than it can ever repay.</p>
<p>GDP is a “wool-over-all-of-our-eyes” metric for the same reason that it excludes the full cost
of maintaining in good condition the social and ecological infrastructure upon which the whole
economy depends. In steering society by GDP, we are effectively managing the planet on an
EBITDA basis. GDP is not just a benignly incomplete measure of wealth, it is the tool with
which we are conning ourselves.</p>
<p>Businesspeople – and homeowners - know how these stories end. Eventually the under-
investment in infrastructure catches up with you. Of course, by then, you hope to have passed
the asset – and the problem – on to someone else. This is feasible, if not best form, where the
asset is not the whole planet. The deception works for as long as you can get away with the
under-investment and the factories and software hold up.
Buffet’s partner, Charlie Munger, is characteristically more forthright on the topic:
“I think that, every time you see the phrase ‘EBITDA earnings,’ you should
substitute the phrase ‘bullshit earnings.’”
By analogy, GDP is “bullshit wealth.” That we have been able to enjoy the comforts of its
deception without mishap for so long is simply because it was introduced against higher
levels of social and ecological infrastructure that we have not yet completely run down. The
under-investment is only now becoming apparent.</p>

<div id="a-besda-economy" class="section level3" number="27.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">27.1.2</span> A BESDA economy</h3>
<p>Long-term or ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors may protest that they
understand all this but that their own investment process insulates them from such blinkered
thinking. (“We don’t use EBITDA”). Yet the point is that the whole financial system is
operating on a “before ecological and social depreciation and amortization” basis – call it
BESDA, perhaps.
So, every single financial metric on the Bloomberg screen is a BESDA metric – profits-
BESDA, earnings per share-BESDA, return on capital-BESDA, return on equity-BESDA, etc.
The millions of financial numbers processed daily by our increasingly automated markets –
which, in turn, steer our economy and drag our culture along behind, ripping up nature in its
wake – are all BESDA numbers. It might not only be EBITDA with which we are conning
ourselves, but every financial number in the book. They all represent different degrees of
disembedded value, some of which we have unmasked, some of which we have not.
We have a sustainability challenge because the entire financial system repeats the problems
of the discredited EBITDA metric at the level of the whole economy. This is the invisible
conceptual cage we have wrapped around our decision-making and from within which the
ESG movement is frantically trying to make a difference. Alas, given the incompleteness of
our markets, the ESG movement increasingly resembles a hopeful grafting of good intentions
onto an unchallenged accounting reality that remains the largely intact source of our
problems. This is the root cause of our collective “greenwish” in which we are hoping that
well-intended efforts to make the world more sustainable are much closer to achieving the
necessary change than they really are</p>
<p><strong>TRUECOST</strong></p>
<p>Trucost, the sustainable consulting
firm, estimated in 2013 that large swathes of primary industry – including agriculture and
energy companies – would simply not be profitable if they had to pay the full costs of their
14
environmental damage. In 2011, the American Economic Review, published similar work
showing that the solid waste combustion, sewage treatment and oil- and coal-fired power
production industries generated air pollution damages – air pollution alone – that were greater
15
than their economic value added (EVA). On this fuller accounting perspective, these are
effectively EVS – economic value subtracted – industries.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">27.2</span> GDP</h2>
<p>For measurement to be accurate, the units must be stable.
Unlike natural scientists, however, economists are not in the business of
carefully defining units using universal physical constants.
Economists instead use prices, a social construct, as their unit of analysis.</p>
<p>The problem is that prices are unstable units of measurement.
Relative prices between commodities vary wildly over time.
This instability means that prices fail the only requirement of a good unit — to be uniform over time.</p>
<p>Instead of reporting the severe uncertainty in ‘real’ GDP, governments report a single official value.
This value hides a myriad of subjective decisions that are used to ‘correct’ for unstable prices.</p>
<p>Instead of wasting time with a useless quantity that reveals nothing profound about the world,
we should seek new pluralistic methods for understanding aggregate economic activity.</p>
<p>Price instability translates into uncertainty in the growth of ‘real GDP.’ While the US government reports only one official measure of ‘real’ GDP, it quietly maintains a database of ‘vintage’ GDP estimates. These are estimates calculated with different base years. Using this ‘vintage’ data, we can quantify the uncertainty in the growth of ‘real’ GDP caused by unstable prices.</p>
<p><img src="fig/gdp_uncertainty_baseyear.png" /></p>
<p>Notice that the official measure of US ‘real’ GDP is at the upper end of the range of uncertainty. We doubt this is a coincidence. In fact, it is common for national governments to boost GDP growth by changing the base year. India recently showed a small increase in GDP growth by choosing a new base year. While this boost was small, it can sometimes be spectacularly large. Nigeria, for instance, recently changed its base year from 1990 to 2010. As a result, real GDP doubled, making Nigeria the largest economy in Africa. Base-year changes have led to similar boosts to GDP growth in Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.</p>
<p>The NIPA Handbook, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental problem confronting the efforts to adjust GDP and other aggregates for inflation is that there is not a single inflation number but rather a wide spectrum of goods and services with prices that are changing relative to one another over time. The index numbers for the individual components can be combined statistically to form an aggregate index, but the method of aggregation that is used affects the movements of the resulting index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ambigous</strong></p>
<p>The growth of ‘real’ GDP is fundamentally uncertain. Or perhaps a better word is ambiguous.</p>
<p>Mainstream economists reach a very different conclusion. Their response is to simultaneously admit that calculating ‘real’ GDP requires arbitrary choices, but then to report a single value as though it was the ‘truth.’</p>
<p><strong>ChainWeighting</strong></p>
<p>The US government currently calculates ‘real’ GDP by adjusting nominal GDP with an aggregate index formed through the multiplication of successive Fisher indexes in adjacent time periods. In popular parlance, this method is called ‘chain-weighting.’ Rather than choose a single base year in which to fix prices, chain-weighting uses a technique that resembles a rolling base year. The method is meant to simulate the effect of changing prices and spending patterns over time.
This method was adopted in the mid-1990s. The official justification was that structural changes in the US economy, especially rapidly falling computer prices, compelled the government to end the fixed base year method.</p>
<p>GDP treats everything with a price as contributing positively to society. Again, this comes down to the assumption that all prices reveal utility. If machine guns sell for the same price as MRI machines, neoclassical theory tells us that both contribute the same utility to society.</p>
<p>In response to such absurdities, ecological economists have developed alternative indicators that subtract the value of social ‘bads’ from the value of social ‘goods.’ While well-motivated, this approach still assumes that we can aggregate the ‘real’ value of ‘goods’ and ‘bads.’ But because prices are unstable, this aggregate is still ill-defined.</p>
<p>‘Real’ GDP is a regressive measure of social progress. Not only is it ill-defined and based on flawed premises, it equates market value with social welfare. This justifies the income of the powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives</strong></p>
<p>The key, we believe, is to separate the study of economic distribution from the study of economic scale. The former is the appropriate domain of prices. The latter is best measured using biophysical units.</p>
<p><em>Prices: Distribution</em></p>
<p>We believe it is important to distinguish between economic <em>distribution</em> and economic <em>scale</em>.
‘Real’ GDP assumes that prices can be used to measure economic scale.
In contrast, we assume that prices do nothing of the sort.
Prices are a tool for distributing resources.
The proper place for prices, then, is for understanding economic distribution.</p>
<p><em>Scale: Energy</em></p>
<p>To measure the scale of the economy, we think it is appropriate to focus on energy. Physicist Eric Chaisson argues that energy is the universal currency of science. By measuring economic scale using energy, we put economics in line with the rest of science. And if we are concerned with sustainability, there is no better starting point than to focus on energy use. After all, the profligate use of fossil fuels under a capitalist economy is the primary driver of climate change.</p>
<p>Energy has many forms as it is flows through society. One possibility is to focus on primary energy consumption, and see how this relates to changes in social structure. Another possibility is to measure ‘useful work’ — the consumption of end-use energy. Still another possibility is to measure the aggregate flow rate, which is a measure of all annual energy conversions in an economic system.</p>
<p>The study of economic growth, which should focus on biophysical flows.</p>
<p>Continuing to use ‘real’ GDP as a measure of social progress implicitly accepts a theory
(neoclassical economics) that has long been used as an ideological justification for capitalist power.</p>
