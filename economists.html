<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.1</span> Joan Robinson</h2>
<p>In the autumn of 1975, there was one name “on everyone’s list for this year’s Nobel Prize in Economics,” Business Week magazine trumpeted: the Cambridge economist Joan Robinson. The week before the prize announcement, the magazine predicted that Robinson would be the first woman to win the prize. A major interpreter of John Maynard Keynes and Karl Marx, she was one of the most prominent economists of her generation.</p>
<p>But when the names of the winners were read out at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Robinson’s name was not among them. When she died in 1983, just shy of her eightieth birthday, she had not won the prize – despite words of support from laureates as different as Paul Samuelson and Milton Friedman.</p>
<p>What went wrong? More than perhaps any other factor, one man was to blame: Mao Zedong. Robinson’s writing in praise of Mao’s China – from her defense of the ruinous Great Leap Forward to her zesty praise of the Cultural Revolution – was likely what lost her the Prize. Fang Qin, an economist at Fudan University in Shanghai, put it plainly: “She is considered the most important female economist in history, but she did not win the Nobel Prize because she publicly praised the Cultural Revolution.”</p>
<p>“How could it happen that, under cover of Mao Tse-tung thought, a medieval drama of ambition and treachery could play itself out?”</p>

<p>At the outset of this debate over capital theory, Professor Joan Rob-
inson argued that capital could not be aggregated using any single
measure because capital assets include a tremendous variety of goods:
physical equipment, real estate, trademarks, financial products, and so
on. 61 The normal remedy — and a move that lies at the heart of the
neoclassical theory of capital — is to group these disparate entities
together as a homogeneous stock or fund, using their market value to
render them commensurate. Piketty adopts this approach, yet a prob-
lem arises when we want to calculate the rate of return on capital that
has been aggregated in this way. According to standard economic theory,
the return on capital should be equivalent to its rental price at
equilibrium — that is, to the cost of hiring capital at a given moment,
independent of any short-term shocks or anomalies. This return
should be equal to the “marginal product” of capital, because (assum-
ing equilibrium) the cost of capital will equal the value of the
additional production it enables. The problem with this solution is that
calculating the equilibrium price of capital assets requires assuming a
given rate of interest, as shown by several technical results from the
1960s and 1970s. 62 But (again according to standard economic theory)
the rate of interest is itself endogenously related to the price of capital
assets: it is supposed to reflect the marginal product of capital.
Calculating the rate of return on capital would thus seem to require
assuming the very thing that the calculation is supposed to discover, making
the exercise circular.</p>

<p>But what determines the rate of return on a capital asset if it is not
simply the value of the additional production it enables? The force of
the debate over this question stemmed from the ideological stakes of
the conventional answer. The theory of marginal productivity was
thought to naturalize capital and its share of national income, rational-
izing profit as simply what was owed to one factor of production, capi-
tal, just as wages were what was owed to labor. 64 Against this, Profes-
sor Piero Sraffa’s seminal contribution was to show that the rate of
return could not be derived from the marginal product of capital but
was rather an independent variable — given, he suggested, by factors
“outside the system of production,” such as monetary policy. 65 In ef-
fect, according to Sraffa, the equilibrium price of capital goods reflects
a history of social struggle over the terms of economic cooperation and
cannot be understood simply in terms of the aggregate production
function.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.3</span> Mario Draghi</h2>
<p><em>Judah on Darghi</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a Europe of the mind: of Beethoven, summer holidays and the smell of coffee.
Then there is Europe as it actually functions today — the Europe of Mario Draghi.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Understand Draghi and you understand how power works in the EU. He has built a
technocratic Europe and risen to its heights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst his generation was wild, flirting with extremism and dreaming of new worlds on
campus, Draghi was tame and burdened by responsibility. An outsider in May ’68.</p>
<p>He was well trained by the Jesuits.
They taught him to be prudent, reserved and to listen. He’s a social Catholic.
It is a class marker that inexorably ties him to Massimiliano Massimo, the Jesuits’
Roman Eton, where Draghi studied with the sons of ministers and tycoons.
t is the sign of a severe, rigorous education at the hands of scholar-priests; and it
is privilege. For Europeans, it is often a way to draw attention to his manner:
pedagogic; precise, shadowy and, if necessary, ruthless.
The Jesuits have a mantra from their founding Saint Ignatius of Loyola about serving
the vision of God: <em>todo modo</em>, which in English means <em>whatever it takes</em>.</p>
<p>As a wave of political killings followed ’68, Draghi learned the first lesson of
political life. Always find the right mentor. His name was Frederico Caffè.
Amidst the clamour he lived, his students said, “like a monk.”
Caffè was influential: Italy’s great Keynesian economist.
Convinced Draghi was brilliant, he introduced him to Franco Modigliani,
the Italian economist at MIT, who accepted him as a student.
But he still had to complete his thesis.
“It was on the single currency and I concluded that the single currency was madness,
something absolutely not to do,” said Draghi, at an event honouring his mentor.</p>
<p>Those who would shape the economic discourse of the age taught Draghi at MIT.
He proudly points out that five of his professors won Nobel Prizes —
Paul Samuelson, Bob Solow, Franco Modigliani, Peter Diamond, and Robert Engle.
His peers — Ben Bernanke, Paul Krugman, Kenneth Rogoff, Olivier Blanchard —
would become high priests of the Federal Reserve, New York Times, austerity and the IMF
respectively.
As the new world of floating exchange rates, free flowing capital and empowered
central bankers was starting to emerge, a circle of economists was coalescing.
Together they shaped the neoliberal age.</p>
<p>Draghi was not looking for dogma. Unlike his mentors, Draghi’s economics has never set into a theory but has kept moving, always one point to the left from wherever the centre is. He sees it as pragmatism. By forty, he had disappointed the left wing Caffè. Draghi was now a Director at the World Bank. In April 1987, overtaken with grief that neoliberalism has triumphed over the left in economics, his disciples dead or fading, Caffè, the great Keynesian, disappeared. He was never seen again. Some say he committed suicide; others that he had taken himself to a monastery in the Alps, to hide from the world he saw coming.</p>
<p>Heading the Treasury from 1991; it was here that the fortysomething civil servant did whatever it took to join the single currency: regulating Italy’s banks, managing its debt and privatizing over €100bn. Draghi was more than indispensable. He built Italian neoliberalism.</p>
<p>There was no better school than Rome for Euro politics: it was already a game of weak politicians and powerful technocrats</p>
<p>Capitalism, he believed, had rules. As long as the politicians got out of the way and the technocrats set the right structure, stable growth would follow.
This was the MIT philosophy. Across continents, his former student peers were rising and rising. As economists they believed in intervention: to help make the market function.</p>
<p>This was why the Euro was imperative. Capitalism could provide the rules — and the structure — that Italy lacked. Politicians would now be curtailed in macroeconomic policy. Signing up to a single currency put the fundamental levers of the macroeconomy — key fiscal and monetary policies — beyond domestic politics. This strategy was known as il vincolo esterno, the external bind.</p>
<p>This is what elites feared in the 1990s: without <em>il vincolo</em>, a return to the 1970s.</p>
<p>Draghi’s generation believed they had got it all right. Then 2008 hit. The financial crisis revealed these engineers had made a terrible mistake. They had broken a system they would now spend the rest of their careers trying to fix.</p>
<p>This would transform central bankers from the technocratic rule setters of capitalism into the political crisis managers who guided it — and in so doing reorder power in the EU forever.</p>
<p>By signalling that Frankfurt was only prepared to put its liquidity behind a certain type of politics he opened the door to ousting Berlusconi. A technocratic government replaced him — which the fallen leader called an EU “coup.”</p>
<p>“In every press conference since I became ECB President, I have ended the introductory statement with a call to accelerate structural reforms in Europe.” Central Bankers had crossed the line: no longer technocrats, they were now politicians.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, Draghi would master the three modes of European power: the charismatic — the politics of persuasion — with which he would claim power for his bank; the technical — the politics of rules — with which he would be the EU enforcer in Greece; and the analytical — the politics of numbers — with which he would win the battle to guide capital flows with quantitative easing. Together these would come together into Draghipolitik — with which he would move the German dial. His challenge was in the very design he agreed to.</p>
<p>Genuinely free markets, which had opened in the 1970s with the lifting of capital controls, closed. Directed capitalism came to Europe with the ECB incentivising markets to buy riskier assets by buying over $2.8 trillion safer ones by 2018. It was the ultimate act of intervention without redistribution.</p>
<p>A whisperer, an enforcer, a number cruncher. These are not the qualities one expects of a great man. But that is to misunderstand how the EU works. Its machine was built to depoliticise politics; and those who do that best, thrive; the unassuming bureaucrat becomes Napoléon.</p>
<p>As the crisis made the state more dependent on finance; finance become more dependent on the state.
And men like Draghi were central to it. These victories reveal enormous skill. They turned the ECB into an even more powerful institution than the Bank of England. But they also underline how badly his generation got it wrong. They had bet on a half-built house for Europe as the key to stability. But a monetary union without a fiscal union brought instability. They had bet on setting neoliberal rules for capitalism and stepping back: and it had blown up. They had bet on austerity: then faced a depression. These errors made them — the world’s elite central bankers who then had to fix it all — more powerful than most politicians.</p>
<p>All through life, Draghi’s personal and political bets have paid off. But at the same time, his great bet, the one he took with Italy — il vincolo esterno — has failed. The geopolitics failed: it has not helped manage German power. The economics failed: Italy has maintained one of the toughest fiscal regimes in Europe, running a primary surplus almost every year since 1995. Yet Italy has got poorer.
In 2000, its average standard of living was 98.6 per cent of that of Germany. Today, Italian per capita income is 20 per cent below those over the Alps. These are the long term consequences of austerity, bottled reform and the Euro making exports uncompetitive. The debt Italy ran up in the 1980s has become its albatross. Draghi’s growth never came.</p>
<p>Italy has been trapped in a loop of increasingly weak populists, punctuated by weak technocrats.</p>
<p>“The truth,” said the historian Marcel Gauchet, “is that Europeans do not know what they have built.” This is what the struggles of Draghi reveal.</p>
<p>The real politics of Europe is the politics of Eurozone debt.</p>
<p>A Euro collapse is now unlikely. That is his legacy. The risk that Europe faces now is that the Euro system — the unfinished house — slowly does to the EU as a whole what it has done to Italy, putting it on a permanently lower growth trajectory. The EU needs collectivised debt for more collective stimulus.</p>
<p>Until someone can pull off the next painful step of consolidation, the risk is that the Union continues to lose the battle for globalisation.</p>
<p>But the price of Draghipolitik is this: it is consolidation without democracy. Empowered elites with alienated voters. Politics only men like him can play.</p>
<p>But what is this Europe? This system, Draghi’s system, is one that has depoliticised itself in order to survive. That it has. But at the cost of no longer being able to distinguish between stability and stagnation. A system that can only do the bare minimum. Not whatever it takes.</p>
