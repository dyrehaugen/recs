<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.1</span> History of Economics’ ‘Externalities’</h2>
<p><em>Duncan Austin</em></p>
<p><strong>Incomplete Markets</strong></p>
<p>Externalities were generally ignored through most of the 20 Century. After Pigou had
identified the problem in the 1920s, there followed a long barren period for “welfare
economics,” the natural home for this type of thinking. This lasted until the early 1970s when there were the first stirrings of renewed interest by serious economists.</p>
<p>Framed as “externalities,” market failures could be more easily dismissed.
The term encourages a perception of unpriced damages as
being mere residuals to the centrepiece of a priced economy.
Since Pigou, some have sought to “beef up” the terminology.
K. William Kapp, for example, bluntly described the market mechanism, in toto,
as a “cost-shifting” institution.
In this framing, externalities are not a bug, but a feature.</p>
<p>The mathematization of economics – another marker of the discipline’s
scientific aspiration – exacerbated the situation.
The desire for manageable equations and functioning models
further pushed troublesome market imperfections away.
Possibly, there was the sense that positive and negative externalities
might roughly cancel each other out, leaving GDP incomplete
but still reliable enough as a directional indicator.
That rests on the assumption that positive and negative externalities are
symmetrical in nature.</p>
<p>However, there is an important asymmetry.
Positive externalities take the form of “free goodies,” whereas certain negative externalities constitute systemic risks that
may be catastrophic to “trip” or breach. While you generally cannot have too much of a
positive externality – a “free good thing” – too much of certain unwanted harms may induce
systemic failure.</p>
<p>Externalities exist because markets have an incomplete grasp of what humans value. Markets
work off prices and not everything has – or can have – a price. As such, marketed values – or
prices – exist amidst a broader “value field” of things that humans care about and which have
an influence on our wellbeing.</p>
<p>Pigou’s proposition was an inconvenient truth for economics. It suggested that there are real
limits to what conventional economics might say about matters of human value and, hence, to
how far markets might serve human wellbeing. The inconvenience of his idea may be why
Pigou is not better known – seemingly more tolerated, than celebrated</p>
<p><strong>Complete markets…?</strong></p>
<p>As a discipline, economics did the very human thing of trying to ignore a difficult proposition.
By not confronting Pigou’s awkward challenge, the door was opened for a line of theorizing
th
that led in exactly the opposite direction. Economists for most of the 20 Century sought to
establish economics as a comprehensive corpus of thought with universal application.</p>
<p>Hence, by the 1950s, a very appealing theory of complete markets had been developed. No
externalities in this theory, none at all.</p>
<p>Complete market theory is the laying
down of a conceptual blanket over all our preferences that leaves no space for externalities.</p>
<p>The formulation of complete markets theory was deemed a major milestone for economics. Its authors were Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu.
It provided the cornerstone for the discipline’s claim for the
superiority of markets as a mechanism for social coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Rather, the key mistake made by 20 Century economics was not in misunderstanding
externalities, but in grossly underestimating their magnitude</strong> and
so foreclosing a debateon the innate limits of economic thinking.
The discipline considered that markets were “complete enough” to
safely proceed as if they were actually complete!
We are now waking up to the consequences of that misjudgement.</p>
<p><strong>… Or very incomplete markets?</strong></p>
<p>Consider, for example, a recent study by Robert Costanza and colleagues. They estimated
the monetary value of the “services” provided free by the Earth’s ecosystem at $125 trillion in
2
2011, nearly twice the value of global GDP (gross domestic product) at the time.
The authors believe this to be a conservative estimate because it grasps only about half of the “services” we know ecosystems provide.</p>
<p>Other studies have contemplated the value of unmonetized social systems, including one
estimate that unpaid housework in the UK in 2016 was about 65 percent of GDP – another
3
huge block of value not captured by the market. Just combining this figure with the Costanza
et al. figure suggests that measured GDP captures about a third of some larger conception of
value.</p>
<p>From its very inception, GDP has been derided as an incomplete measure of wellbeing.
However, in elevating GDP to its current perch of influence, the working assumption has been
that GDP, and the market system it reflects, captures the lion’s share of what matters. What
the latest estimates of “externalities” and non-market values suggest – and what our
sustainability crisis seems to underscore – is that our perception of GDP’s reach may be
horribly off. Such an estimate suggests that it is not that the market does not capture <em>all</em> things of value, it does not even capture <em>most</em> things of value.
<strong>Far from externalities being peripheral, they may be the main event!</strong></p>
<p>The failure of economics to fully incorporate externalities in its 20th-century
theorizing now appears to be the dropped stitch that defines the whole discipline. For a long
time, this was a tolerable neglect as markets were more robustly counterbalanced by pre-
market institutions that upheld unpriced values, and as the environment was able to absorb
the fewer demands of a smaller, less consumptive population. But, with the onset of climate
and biodiversity emergencies, the context has changed considerably. It matters more and
more that we might not have <em>slightly incomplete markets</em>, but <em>very incomplete markets</em>.</p>
<p>It has left us at the start of the 21 Century transforming
the matter and energy of the world using
economic and financial tools that have only
a very limited grasp of the reality they fashion.</p>
<p>In a world of very incomplete markets, things of human value lie in two separate realms – the
marketed domain and the non-marketed domain. Some of the growth of the marketed
economy genuinely arises from human ingenuity and creativity unlocking better ideas and
products from new combinations of inputs. This is “good” growth, which ought to be
celebrated and encouraged. However, other parts of monetized “growth” arise from simply
running down the stocks of what is valuable but in the non-marketed realm. This is the illusion
of wealth creation based on registering the increase in marketed value, but not recording the
decrease in unmarketed values. In contrast to growth from genuine ingenuity, this is robbing
Peter to pay Paul.</p>
<p>Measured economic “growth” overall combines in unknown proportions a “creative
growth,” which we want to encourage, and a “parasitic growth,” which we do not. At an
aggregate level, it is almost impossible to trace the origins – creative or parasitic – of GDP
growth, and very few official metrics make any attempt to do so.</p>
<p>Our working assumption is that all
economic growth is good – as it indeed would be if we had complete markets eliminating the
possibility of parasitic growth. However, in not knowing the real-world mix between creative
and parasitic growth, do we want more GDP growth, or less? It is not clear. And, given that
companies work to the same price register as GDP, do we want companies to beat profit
expectations or would it be better if they missed them? Who really knows?
The conventional argument – captured by the notion of an Environmental Kuznets Curve – is
that it is only by increasing monetary wealth that we can develop better technology to protect
the environment. However, it is not clear in the aggregate whether the deployment of such
new capabilities ever makes good the damage done by the initial enabling wealth creation.
While anecdotes can be summoned to support the idea – electric cars, wind turbines, LEDs
etc – thus far, at the global level that matters, data shows we remain in net ecological
destruction mode.</p>
<p><strong>Markets within Cultures</strong></p>
<p>Paradoxically, then, to use markets more than we are, to introduce more externality pricing,
would require a new cultural level reassertion that markets are a tool within culture. We need
not a sustainable economy, but a sustainable culture that has an economy. Such a culture
would establish room for governments to introduce new markets which powerful market
ncumbents may not like, but which improve human wellbeing. In turn, such a culture would
also invigorate non-market means to protect our environment, for we must remember that not
everything of human value can be priced and “internalized.” The interesting question, worth a
moment’s reflection, is: why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Commodifiable Externalities</strong></p>
<p>Though Pigou identified commodifiable externalities, there are many things of human value
that cannot withstand the disembedding from their context necessary for them to be
commodified and, hence, be transactable via market exchange. Such values are non-
transactable because they are irrevocably embedded either in specific things – they are
unique – or in specific relations – they exist “between” certain things. Some examples:
friendship, reputation, loyalty, integrity, trust, community, mental health, etc. If you believe you
have purchased any of these items, you might want to check the label.</p>
<p>What is tricky is that most things in the world bear both separable transactable values and
intrinsic non-transactable values. A tree has both separable value as a feedstock for furniture
and paper and intrinsic value as part of the ecosystem in which it is relationally embedded.</p>
<p>We tend to value trees in managed plantations for their separable values, but we value
General Sherman, the 26-story-tall giant sequoia that is the largest known tree on Earth, for
its non-separable attribute of being uniquely the tree we call General Sherman.
With General Sherman, we have chosen to perceive and value its uniqueness over its
instrumental value. Indeed, we might say that General Sherman is price-less. The
“economist” denies the validity of this perspective by arguing that everything has a price. To
say that something is priceless is merely to say that nobody has yet offered a high enough
price.
In turn, the “ecologist” denies the “economist’s” perspective, arguing that while you can apply
such economic thinking to General Sherman, it is the wrong sort of thinking to apply.</p>
<p>Both the “economic” transactional perspective and the “ecological” intrinsic perspective are
beneficial and valid, but they are incompatible.</p>
<p>The decision to
apply an economic perspective to the external world is always a value judgment that
necessarily transcends economics. More, it is a value judgment that can never be justified or
refuted on economic grounds precisely because it is an argument about the validity of
applying an economic perspective.</p>
<p>All this is a discussion that the field of economics may well have taken more seriously 100
years ago, had it been more open to the significance and implications of Pigou’s formulation
of externalities. Alas, we are now having to unknit to pick up this dropped stitch in a world now
confronting large-scale problems of missed externalities.</p>
<p><strong>Incompletness Theorem of Economics</strong></p>
<p>Economics might be well served by formalizing an incompleteness theorem that would act as
a proverbial knot-in-a-handkerchief reminder about the limits of claims that economics can
make. It is an oddity of human intellectual thought that the most logical of our sciences,
mathematics, had a formal Incompleteness Theorem as early as 1930, while economics
formalized a complete market theory in the 1950s and seemingly still has no definitive
statement of incompleteness.</p>
<p><strong>Ringfecing Economics</strong></p>
<p>One of the ways, then, that we could better protect ecological values is for economics to
recognize – re-cognize – the wisdom of culturally ring-fencing where economic thinking is
preferred. In other words, to recognize the non-monetizable value of non-economic thinking.</p>
<p>Designating areas as protected are to explicitly restrain the ever-eager economic perspective.
Such boundaries need to be upheld at the social or cultural level to count for anything.
If not individuals can always free ride and extract the monetary instrumental value
that others have agreed not to pursue.</p>
<p>While economics is undoubtedly <em>a</em> valuable form of knowledge, it is a way of seeing things,
not <em>the</em> way.</p>
<p>A full century after Pigou formalized the idea of externalities, we might mark the
anniversary by taking more seriously the effort to clarify the appropriate reach of economics
and markets within the broader social and cultural context.</p>
<p><strong>Economics is about solved Political Problems</strong></p>
<p>Arguably, one of the most important questions in economics is not even an economic
question.
The field effectively punts the matter of its own ontology – the things that economics
can talk about – to a different discipline. In Abba Lerner’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An economic transaction is a solved political problem. Economics has
gained the title of Queen of the Social Sciences by choosing solved political
problems as its domain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economics has been strangely content to focus its efforts on pattern-seeking within a domain
it leaves other disciplines to define, but in the absence of contemplating its boundaries more
explicitly, it has hubristically come to believe it has greater reach than it really has.</p>
<p>In turn, this leaves most economists – and the great many people who think and act
economically in conducting their professional duties – dangerously unaware of where
economic thinking is beneficial and valid and where it ultimately hits limits.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.2</span> Ecosystem Services</h2>
<p><em>Constanza</em></p>
<p>• Global loss of ecosystem services due to land use change is $US 4.3–20.2 trillion/yr.
• Ecoservices contribute more than twice as much to human well-being as global GDP.
• Estimates in monetary units are useful to show the relative magnitude of ecoservices.
• Valuation of ecosystem services is not the same as commodification or privatization.
• Ecosystem services are best considered public goods requiring new institutions.</p>
<p>In 1997, the global value of ecosystem services was estimated to average $33 trillion/yr in 1995 $US ($46 trillion/yr in 2007 $US). In this paper, we provide an updated estimate based on updated unit ecosystem service values and land use change estimates between 1997 and 2011. We also address some of the critiques of the 1997 paper. Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is $125 trillion/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and $145 trillion/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 $US. From this we estimated the loss of eco-services from 1997 to 2011 due to land use change at $4.3–20.2 trillion/yr, depending on which unit values are used. Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization. Many eco-services are best considered public goods or common pool resources, so conventional markets are often not the best institutional frameworks to manage them. However, these services must be (and are being) valued, and we need new, common asset institutions to better take these values into account.</p>

<p><em>Abstract Maneejuk:</em></p>
<p>This study aims to examine the relationship between economic development and
environmental degradation based on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The level
of CO 2 emissions is used as the indicator of environmental damage to determine whether or not greater
economic growth can lower environmental degradation under the EKC hypothesis. The investigation
was performed on eight major international economic communities covering 44 countries across
the world. The relationship between economic growth and environmental condition was estimated
using the kink regression model, which identifies the turning point of the change in the relationship.
The findings indicate that the EKC hypothesis is valid in only three out of the eight international
economic communities, namely the European Union (EU), Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), and Group of Seven (G7). In addition, interesting results were obtained
from the inclusion of four other control variables into the estimation model for groups of countries
to explain the impact on environmental quality. Financial development (FIN), the industrial sector
(IND), and urbanization (URB) were found to lead to increasing CO 2 emissions, while renewable
energies (RNE) appeared to reduce the environmental degradation. In addition, when we further
investigated the existence of the EKC hypothesis in an individual country, the results showed that the
EKC hypothesis is valid in only 9 out of the 44 individual countries.</p>

<a href="pdf/Maneejuk_2020_Does_EKC_exist.pdf">(pdf)</a></p>
<p>The Kuznets curve expresses a hypothesis advanced by economist Simon Kuznets in the 1950s and 1960s.
<strong>As an economy develops, market forces first increase and then decrease economic inequality.</strong></p>
<p>Since 1991 the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) has become
a standard feature in the technical literature of environmental policy,
though its application there has been strongly contested.</p>
<p>The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) is a hypothesized relationship between environmental quality and
GDP growth:
according to its argument, which is spurious,
various indicators of environmental degradation tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs
until average income reaches a certain point over the course of development,
at which point some studies have argued, they improve.</p>
<p>It first became popular as introduced by Gene Grossman and Paul Krueger in their working paper:
“Environmental Impacts of a North American Free Trade Agreement.”
This paper simply showed that the non-direct Greenhouse gas, Sodium Dioxide, Dark Matter,
and Suspended particles followed an inverted-U shaped pattern.
This was almost immediately misinterpreted by the World Bank and Beckerman and
adopted into policy as an argument that all negative environmental effects would follow an EKC pattern.
Copious research has concluded that beyond these pollutants, and issues like water quality,
that immediately threaten human health,
GDP growth essentially harms, and does not help the environment with no lasting “turning point.”
The EKC has led to poor policy choices reaping untold environmental damage.</p>
