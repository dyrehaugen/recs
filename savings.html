<h1><span class="header-section-number">34</span> Savings</h1>
<p><em>Stropoli</em></p>
<p>While many economists think more saving leads to productive investment, Sufi, Princeton’s Atif Mian, and Harvard’s Ludwig Straub make a different argument. They find that these savings are largely unproductive, being remade by the financial system into household and government debt. And their research outlines a cycle whereby the savings of the top 1 percent fuel the debt and dissavings of the lower 90 percent, which in turn leads to more savings at the top.</p>
<p>From the 1980s through 2007, the top 1 percent financed a large portion of the overall rise in household debt for the lower 90 percent, according to the researchers. And as the rich have accumulated capital, the less wealthy have accumulated fewer assets, which means they experience less financial stability overall. Thus, the work argues, the savings glut of the rich, and its role in financing unproductive debt and dissavings of the nonrich, leads to instability not only for the less economically privileged but also for the broad economy.</p>
<p>Mian and Sufi argue in 2018 research that a rapid flow of foreign funds into the US triggered a credit-supply expansion that boosted household debt, which they say was a major factor in igniting the financial crisis.</p>
<p>From 1982 to 2016, the glut of the US rich was, on average, 60–75 percent of the size of the global glut. And at times in the 1990s and 2010s, the amount rich Americans put away even exceeded the global glut.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse’s 2020 wealth report finds that the US has about 20 million millionaires, 40 percent of the global total. Meanwhile, the Billionaire Census 2020 from Wealth-X, which provides information and insight on the world’s wealthiest individuals, finds the US has about 28 percent of the world’s billionaires, who hold a 36 percent share of global billionaire wealth. The world now has a record 2,755 billionaires, according to Forbes.</p>
<p>The top 1 percent of households in the US have just as much influence as emerging-market economies in fueling the debt of the bottom 90 percent.</p>
<p><strong>More savings, less investment</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, all those savings would be channeled into productive investments such as research and development, or practical equipment, or new roads, or even new yachts—investments that would promote growth in the economy. However, from 2000 through 2016, the average annual savings of the top 1 percent exceeded average annual net domestic investment as a percentage of GDP.
While the rich saved more, investment in productive assets declined.</p>
<p>Those savings were put to use financing both household and government debt.
Between 2000 and 2016, they find that claims on household and government debt account for nearly two-thirds of the rise in asset accumulation of the top 1 percent in the US.</p>
<p>In the 25 years leading up to the 2008–09 financial crisis the top 1 percent financed almost a third of the rise in household debt owed by the bottom 90 percent.
In the years since the crisis, and since the housing bubble burst, the savings of the rich have gone more toward government debt</p>
<p>Not all household and government debt is unproductive, of course. More than one entrepreneur has financed a startup on a credit card or with a personal loan. However, much household debt goes toward instruments such as mortgages and home equity loans, which can be used speculatively, in which case they are less productive than, say, investments in manufacturing plants or technology. Thus, the researchers argue that mortgages, while enabling homeownership, can also help perpetuate a cycle of wealth inequality.</p>
<p>The rich are seeking returns on their excess savings because, as Sufi says, many of them “just cannot spend all the money they make.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US government, by providing tax breaks on debt interest, and by encouraging banks to lend via debt financing, promotes less-productive investment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonfinancial corporations have increased their holdings of money market funds and time deposits by 10 percentage points of national income since 1995.</p>
<p>Since the early 2000s, the amount of corporate saving not invested in new capital has increasingly accumulated as cash.</p>
<p>Say a corporation issues equity to the wealthy, but instead of spending the proceeds on research or equipment, puts that money into a time deposit at a bank, which in turn uses it to fund a mortgage for a less-affluent household. This is how the rich become lenders.</p>
<p>Some politicians, economists, and pundits say that people are borrowing (and consuming) irresponsibly. But banks with all that cash on hand work to expand the credit market and realize returns on the savings glut of the rich. The bottom 90 percent are being convinced to borrow more and more, through lower interest rates, easier credit, and more advertising.</p>
<p>From the 1980s through 2007, the net amount of household debt that the top 1 percent held as a financial asset rose by 15 percentage points of national income, while at the same time the amount of household debt that the bottom 90 percent owed as a liability rose by 40 percentage points. The so-called accumulated dissavings of the bottom 90 percent from 1983 to 2015, relative to the average level from 1973 to 1982, was over twice the national income, the researchers say.</p>
<p><strong>The debt trap</strong></p>
<p>As the savings of the rich go toward the borrowing of the nonrich, there may be a GDP boost in the short run, as it does encourage consumption. But the debt becomes a drag on future demand.
The cycle of unproductive debt makes it hard for consumer demand to support full employment in the economy, and it ultimately forces central banks to lower interest rates.
While lower rates may strengthen demand for a time, consistently low rates may be problematic.
Persistent low demand can foster a high-debt liquidity trap—or debt trap—in which economies are stuck in long periods of sluggish growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2021/article/how-1-percent-s-savings-buried-middle-class-debt">Stropoli (2021) How the 1 percent’s savings buried the middle class in debt</a></p>
<p><strong>Inequality</strong></p>
<p>Wealth among the superrich has been fueled by a marriage of in-demand skills, globalization, and technology—the combination of which are <em>allowing businesses to scale up as never before</em>.</p>
<p>Skills, say many economists, are critical to the modern economy. As the US economy grows, jobs are going unfilled as companies scramble to find skilled people to hire. There’s a flip side to this: as certain skills have become scarce, this has raised the amount companies are willing to pay people who have them. The situation has similarly raised the amount of profits skilled company owners can make, and technology and globalization are further magnifying the value of in-demand skills.
If this is true, the 0.01 percent are most likely benefiting from what economists call “skill-biased technological change”—the increasing return on certain skills in an economy driven by technology and globalization
Under this well-established theory, a shortage of in-demand skills raises the value of those skills in rapidly expanding markets, and new technology helps some workers’ productivity grow much more than others’, exacerbating inequality.</p>
<p>In the Information Age, the change has been particularly pronounced. “In business, you can use technology to do things you couldn’t do 30 years ago,” says Steve Kaplan. “You can scale your business using technology, and you can use people in India and China and all over the world—you couldn’t do that as effectively 30 years ago.” This, he argues, has been spectacularly positive for poorer people in developing countries. In 1990, the World Bank estimated that roughly 35 percent of the world lived in extreme poverty. Today, less than 11 percent of the world’s population is so impoverished.</p>
<p>And it has been good for wealthy residents of developed countries. For them, the result has taken the form of the “superstar” or “winner-take-all” phenomenon, first identified in a landmark 1981 paper by the late Sherwin Rosen, who taught at the University of Chicago. “In certain kinds of economic activity there is concentration of output among a few individuals,” wrote Rosen. “Relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and dominate the activities in which they engage.”</p>
<p>Technology allows a hedge fund to be able to manage $20 billion and invest it,” says Steve Kaplan. “I don’t think people had the systems and information to do that 20 to 30 years ago. Now they have the systems and the information to do that. That technological change is here and is not going away. If anything, it’s getting stronger.”</p>

<div id="guard-rail-economics" class="section level2" number="34.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.1</span> Guard Rail Economics</h2>
<p><em>Stern</em></p>
<p>We risk loss of life in the hundreds of millions or billions; because we do not know what the “carrying
capacity” of a world of 4 or 5 o C might be. It could be much lower than the 9-10 billion or so expected
towards the end of the century. It is hard to understand or put numbers on the potential devastation and
agony around the process of loss of life that could be involved.
<strong>It is difficult, in particular, to argue that
an expected utility approach captures the issues at stake in a plausible way.</strong>
In my view, a direct risk-assessment looking across possible consequences
and a guard-rail approach is more thoughtful,
reasoned, broad-ranging and robust.
And it is clearly seen as a reasonable and rational approach by
the body-politic.</p>
<p><strong>A new form of Growth</strong>
The necessary rapid change across the whole system, just described, can be a story of growth, indeed
the only sustainable story of growth. In the shorter term, the necessary investments can boost demand
in a world where planned savings exceed planned investments (with sluggish demand and low real
interest rates). In the short and medium term it is full of innovation, investment, discovery, and new
ways of doing things. It can be more efficient; and much cleaner. It can create cities where we can move
and breathe, and ecosystems which are robust and fruitful. It is potentially a very attractive, different
way of doing things, relative to past dirty models, with so many gains across the different dimensions
of well-being. But that does not mean that it is easy. It does mean that it is sensible, it does mean that
it is attractive, and it is within our grasp. We have to change radically and, particularly, invest and
innovate strongly to get there. That is the challenge. But there can be a real payoff in terms of a much
better form of growth.</p>
<p>Can it be done? The answer is ‘yes’ and in particular there are four forces at this current moment which
are particularly favourable to moving quickly and on scale: low interest rates, rapid technological change
(see section 2.4), international understandings coming together (including the UNFCCC, COP21, the
Paris agreement of 2015 and more than 100 countries covering 61% of emissions committing to net-
zero by mid-century (Black, et al., 2021)), and pressure from the young people of the world to change
(for example, Fridays for the Future and strong activity in the universities of the world).</p>
<p><strong>Investment</strong>
Strong, internationally coordinated investment should be at centre stage,
right through from recovery from the COVID pandemic to transformational growth and
the drive to a net-zero economy.
What kind of orders of magnitude of investment do we need to make? To bring
through the new ways of doing things and the new technologies required to make
that happen, we have to increase investment by around 2-3 percentage points of GDP
across the world, relative to the previous decade.</p>
<p><strong>Policy</strong>
These increases in investment, will require strong policy and a positive investment climate, including
the functioning of relevant governmental institutions. Further, the many relevant market failures (see
section 7b) and the urgency of change indicate the necessity of a whole range of policy instruments.
Carbon pricing will be important, but alone it will not be enough. Complementary policies, including city
design, regulation and standards, and investments in R&amp;D, will also be needed.</p>
<p><strong>Finance</strong>
Getting the right kind of finance, in the right place, at the right time is not easy. Mobilising private
sector finance, at scale, will be critical. But there will also be a need for development finance and
concessional finance to support the activities that do not quickly generate strong revenue streams or
have high risks. The international financial institutions, especially the multilateral development banks,
and including the IMF, have a crucial role to play.</p>
<p><strong>How economics must change</strong>
An assessment of what the current situation demands of us, particularly for this decade, was set out. That requires changing our ways of producing and consuming, rapidly and fundamentally, and
creating the investment, innovation, sets of policies, and the finance that could foster and support the
change. How can we bring our economics to bear in a way that informs those very real and urgent
problems? How can we use economic analysis to tell us as much as it possibly can about why to do
this, how to do this, and the methods and policy instruments we should use?</p>
<p>I will focus,
in terms of broad analytical approaches, on where we are in the economics discipline on climate change
and argue that it is time for change in the economics of climate change and, in some respects,
economics generally.
Our subject does have much to offer in
applying our existing tools and in developing new perspectives and analyses, but we must be innovative
and, as a profession, engage much more strongly on this, the biggest issue of our times.</p>
<p>A starting point is the important set of insights of economists Alfred Marshall and Arthur Pigou.
At the end of the 19 th century, Marshall (Marshall, 1890) drew attention to the potential difference
between marginal private cost and marginal social cost. Thirty years later, Pigou (Pigou, 1920) argued
for a tax, equal to the difference between the marginal private cost and the marginal social cost, to
correct for an externality, where that is the source of the difference 11 .
Around 60 or 70 years ago, Ronald Coase began considering these concepts in a different way,
emphasising institutional arrangements (Coase, 1960). He spoke of allocating property rights and
establishing markets so that there could be trade in externalities. James Meade - his work ‘Trade and
Welfare’ (Meade, 1955) was a landmark - also wrote very insightfully about the theory of externalities,
including integrating externalities into the theory of reform, bringing in distributional issues and looking
at general equilibrium in multi-good models. Coming forward further, and looking at applications 30 or
so years ago, David Pearce, for example, was writing ‘Blueprint for a Green Economy’, emphasising
how the Pigouvian idea could be implemented (Pearce et al., 1989).</p>
<p>The modelling of climate change
began with Bill Nordhaus’ important and admirable paper ‘To slow or not to slow?’, published in the
Economic Journal in 1991 (Nordhaus, 1991) and Bill Cline published his book ‘The Economics of Global Warming’ in 1992 (Cline, 1992).</p>
<p>Nordhaus’s question, recognising that there could be potential dangers
from climate change and that emissions arose from activities around producing and consuming, was
‘should we grow a little less fast than we might have envisaged before we thought about climate
change?’. He proceeded in a sensible way, taking an emerging problem and applying the standard tools
of economics: first the Pigouvian story of marginal social costs, marginal private costs, and taxing for
the externality; second on growth, he used the framework of a standard exogenous growth model and
considered the impact of climate change largely in terms of small perturbations around the underlying
growth path(s). That was a sensible early contribution for the economics of climate change.</p>
<p>Over the following 10-15 years, it became more and more clear that
<strong>climate change is not a marginal problem.</strong>
We are dealing with a challenge involving huge potential disruptions, which requires very
radical changes in our production systems and ways of consuming. That simply cannot be picked up
by assuming a fairly standard underlying model of exogenous growth and, within that model, portraying
climate change in terms of marginal damages of just a few percent of GDP. Nordhaus’ DICE model
launched a major literature on integrated assessment models (IAMs), and their scope has been
expanded. But the basic underlying features of optimisation of explicit, calibrated social welfare
functions, underlying exogenous growth and aggregation (usually to one good) impose severe limitation
on their ability to illuminate two basic questions.</p>
<p>The <em>first</em> is how to approach analytically the challenge
of managing immense risk, which could involve loss of life on a massive scale. The <em>second</em> is how to
chart and guide a response to this challenge which will involve fundamental structural change across a
whole complex economy. These two issues are at the core of economic policy on climate. The basic
structure of IAMs, I shall argue, even with the many advances and mutations that have been offered, is
not of a form which can tackle these two questions in any satisfactory way.</p>
<p><strong>There is a problem in the profession</strong>, which goes beyond the way IAMs are structured and specified,
associated with an inability or unwillingness to move much beyond the static Pigouvian or 20 th century
approach to externalities in analysing the challenges of climate change.
Many discussions of policy suggest that “economic theory says” that
policy should be overwhelmingly about a <strong>carbon price</strong>.</p>
<p>That “theory says” that the carbon price is the most effective route is simply wrong
and involves a number of mistakes.</p>
<p>The first mistake is that there is a whole collection of market failures and market absences of great
relevance beyond the greenhouse gas externality (see section 7). The second is that under the
temperature target or guardrail approach (see section1), the choice of carbon prices is focused on its
role, in combination with other policies, in incentivising paths which achieve the overall target (such as
net-zero emissions by mid-century to fit with the temperature target) with as much economic advantage
as possible. Such prices are not simply the marginal social cost as in Pigou (see discussion of Stern-
Stiglitz Commission below, this section). Third, where the risks of moving too slowly are potentially very
large and there are increasing returns to scale and fixed costs in key industries, then regulations can
help reduce uncertainty and bring down costs (e.g. Weitzman, 1974). Fourth, many consumers,
producers, cities, and countries, recognise the obligation to act, and are not blinkered, narrow optimisers
with a view of utility focused only on their own consumption. Fifth, much of the challenge of action is
how to promote collaboration and act together. This poses a whole set of important questions around
institutions and actions for mutual support. This is an immense challenge concerning risk, values,
dynamics and collaboration, and <strong>the narrow Pigouvian model, useful though it is,is very far from the whole story.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Failure of IAMs</strong>
There is an underlying
one-good growth model where emissions depend on output, accumulated emissions cause temperature
increase and climate change, and emissions can be reduced by incurring costs. However, much of this
literature, which has dominated so much work on the economics of climate change, has been
misleading and biased against strong action, because climate damage specifications are implausibly
low and costs of action implausibly high, and subject to diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Most standard IAMs also embody diminishing returns to scale and increasing marginal costs of action
to reduce emissions, plus modest rates of technical progress (relative to those experienced in the last
decade or so). These features are very problematic because we have already seen how important
increasing returns to scale and very rapid change in technology are in this context.</p>
<p>By embodying diminishing returns and modest technical progress,
the IAMs systematically overstate the costs of climate action. Further, they distort the theory of policy
which is much more complex when we have increasing returns to scale; particularly in the context of
risk. Standard optimising policy models which focus on “marginal cost equals marginal benefit” are far
more tractable with diminishing returns and increasing marginal costs to action, but by choosing model
assumptions primarily for tractability and convenience, we risk severely disturbing the policy discussion
at issue.</p>
<p>There are <strong>deeper problems</strong> with the general approach of
maximising a social welfare function (for example, based on expected utility) in the presence of extreme
risk, which cannot be corrected by adjusting functions and parameters.
Standard utility or welfare functions at the heart of the IAMs cannot capture
adequately the nature and scale of the risks from climate change.
Impacts which can involve deaths of billions are not easily captured in the standard social welfare
functions, which we used in most IAMs (and more broadly), involving aggregation of individual utility
functions. Indeed, as Weitzman argued (Weitzman, 2009, 2012) standard approaches quickly run into
problems of utility functions going to minus infinity. There can be arbitrary “fixes”, for example by putting
bounds on utility, but it is an indication that the model has lost touch with the problem.</p>
<p>Just as with the social welfare function aspect of IAMs, there is a deeper question on the production
side of the modelling. The policy challenge, as we have seen, involves generating rapid and major
change in key complex systems, including energy, transport, cities and land, over a very short period.
<strong>Simple “cost” functions</strong> for emissions reductions, even if made more realistic, do not get to grips with the real policy challenges of how to make these changes.</p>
<p>We are in a world with many market imperfections, with major risks, requiring
fundamental systemic change, and where optimisation is difficult to define, let alone achieve.</p>
<p>There is no serious ethical argument in favour of pure-time <strong>discounting</strong>.</p>
<p>There is little point in looking for ethical values relevant to
social discounting in capital markets, because capital markets: (i) do not reflect ethical social decisions;
(ii) they embody expectations and views about risk that are hard to identify; and (iii) they involve many
imperfections. Nevertheless, one often seems to hear the mistaken argument that social preferences
can be derived from these markets.</p>
<p><strong>Economic analyses of climate change</strong> must first capture <em>extreme risk</em>, including possible large-scale and unforeseeable consequences. Second, they should recognise that many key markets have
<em>critically important failures</em> (beyond that of the GHG externality), that crucial markets may be absent,
and that there are limits on the ability of government to “correct” these market failures or absences.
Third, they should embody <em>rapid technical and systemic change</em>, often in very large and complex
systems such as cities, energy, transport, and land use, and allow for increasing returns to scale.
Fourth, they should examine rapid changes in (endogenously determined) <em>beliefs and preferences</em>;
and fifth, take into account <em>distributive impacts</em> and risks, both at a moment in time and over time, and
including those associated with structural change. All of this will unavoidably involve explicit analysis
and discussion of <em>value judgements</em>. These components, or sets of questions, are difficult to
incorporate in standard integrated assessment modelling, but are at the core of the issues around
understanding policy towards climate change. We must deepen our economic analysis to incorporate
them. We should also recognise that questions embodied in, or similar to, these components arise in
many other parts of economics, where major risks and fundamental change are at the core of the
challenge under examination.</p>
<p>Given that governments are made up of complex compromises and coalitions, are limited in
information and capabilities, and are not necessarily long lasting, we must recognise in our analysis
that there are limits on their ability or willingness to “correct” for market failures and absent markets.
Governments cannot fully commit to future actions in a credible way.</p>
<p>The GHG failure is top of our list of market failures. And carbon pricing has a critical role to play in
tackling that market failure. However, we can see, from thinking about different aspects of market and
government failures, that the policy question is much richer than carbon pricing alone.
Regulatory
policies, alongside carbon pricing, could be more efficient and effective than carbon pricing alone.</p>
<p>The need for new approaches to economic analysis of climate change raises an enormously rich
research agenda. At the same time, action on scale is urgent.</p>
<p>The necessary transformation of the economy relies critically on changing key systems: energy, cities,
transport, land use. These large and complex systems cannot be changed by fiddling with just one
parameter, a whole set of policies will be required to foster change. For example, you would not sensibly
attempt to redesign a city to reduce congestion and pollution just via a carbon price.</p>
<p>Most elements of economics come into the challenge of climate change.
It is time for change in economics.</p>

<p><em>Keen on Dietz</em></p>
<p>This was an invited talk to the Oxford Department of International Development “Climate Change and the Challenges of Development Lecture Series”, on my criticisms of the application of neoclassical economics to climate change. I focused on the new paper by Dietz et al. that allegedly calculates the economic costs of tipping points: Dietz, S., J. Rising, T. Stoerk and G. Wagner (2021). “Economic impacts of tipping points in the climate system.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118(34): e2103081118.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, this papers fails to consider tipping points in any credible way, and this is obvious in its incredible claim (in the original sense of the “not credible”), that:</p>
<pre><code>“Tipping points reduce global consumption per capita by around 1% upon 3°C warming and by around 1.4% upon 6°C warming&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This is ridiculous: the tipping points they consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Arctic summer sea ice,</p></li>
<li><p>The Greenland Ice Sheet,</p></li>
<li><p>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet,</p></li>
<li><p>The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (“Gulf Stream”),</p></li>
<li><p>The Amazon Rainforest,</p></li>
<li><p>The Indian Monsoon,</p></li>
<li><p>Permafrost, and</p></li>
<li><p>Ocean methane hydrates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If all 8 of these tripped–especially with a temperature 3-6°C above pre-industrial levels–we would be experiencing a climate utterly unlike anything Earth has seen for tens of millions of years. The thought that this would just reduce global consumption by just 1.4%–compared to what it would be if none of these tipping points were triggered–doesn’t pass what Nobel Laureate Robert Solow once called “the smell test”: “every proposition has to pass a smell test: Does it really make sense?”.</p>
<p>I show why this paper stinks in Solow’s sense <a href="https://www.patreon.com/file?h=57752646&amp;i=9166994">(slides here)</a>.</p>
